# janus_videoroom

This is a video conference app based on the Janus WenRTC server. It has been made from their official <a href="https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/blob/master/html/videoroomtest.js">videoroom demo</a> by extracting the WenRTC-related logic and fully rewriting its presentation layer. Some basic server functionality (room - wide password and settings) was also added in php.

This is a free software under GPL 3.0 or higher license.
